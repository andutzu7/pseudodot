- why is periodic
- what is periodic
- why only between 0 and 1
- how to loop over the interval






# notes:
- these functions are ***always*** computed within a right angled triangle
- because of this, we re allowed to make sin cos blabla for angles greater than 90
- its periodic because it s an angle ratio, encapsuled in a circle, so sizez don't matter bcs they must be proportional
